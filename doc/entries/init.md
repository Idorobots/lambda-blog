Title: λ-blog v1.0.0 has been released!
ID: init
Summary: Initial release of the λ-blog tagged v1.0.0.
Tags: changelog
      v1.0.0

A quick overview of the features you get out of the box:

* Generates truly static pages that work with JavaScript disabled.
* Uses composable, Clojure-based HTML templates.
* Uses Markdown files for content management.

...but, of course, this wouldn't be customizable enough so **λ-blog** additionally gives you:

* Full control over the project layout.
* Full control over the generation pipeline.
* Ability to override everything according to your liking.
