# Hello world!

Welcome to {{name}}, you've made it!

## First steps

Here's a couple of things you might want to do:

* Edit this entry - it is found in the `resources/entries` directory.

* Edit your scripts & stylesheets in `resources/js` and `resources/css` directories.

* Customize your generation pipeline (including the templates) to your liking. It is found in the `src/{{sanitized}}/core.clj` file.

Happy blogging!
